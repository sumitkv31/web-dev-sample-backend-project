-->when we require dynamic route ? 
    in this example user recommend there restaurant 
    now for their recommended website we want to assign a proper website (route)
    now since any no. of website can be recommended by users so we cannot hardcode route 
    so we develop dynamic route for it 

--> DEVELOPING DYNAMIC ROUTE USING EXPRESS

    step 1 --> The place where user recommend new restaurant we add the link to this new dynamic route 

     <div class="restaurant-actions">
      <a href="/restaurants/r1">View Restaurant</a>
     </div>

     step 2 --> add a detail page which will serve as dynamic page based on each user recommend 
                by adding--> restaurant-detail.ejs

                <h1>TITLE OF THE RESTAURANT <%= rid %></h1> --> adding this kind of line--> restaurant-detail.ejs --> make page dynamic 

     step 3 -->  Now we define a dynamic route in app.js 

                app.get('/restaurants/:id',function(req,res){
                    const restaurantId =  req.params.id; //we get our id 
                    res.render('restaurant-detail',{rid:restaurantId});
                }); 

    step 4 --> when user requested /restaurants/:id we will render restaurant-detail page with data passed to restaurant-detail page based on id 

                in restaurant-detail.ejs 
                <h1>TITLE OF THE RESTAURANT <%= rid %></h1>


    /restaurants/:id
    here we should note that these detail page might not load css files correctly 
    as css file is sibling of restaurant but here it might consider it sibling of id so child of restaurants
    so to solve this problem we do not load css files like 'style.css'. actually we load it like '/style.css'

    1st mtd (style.css) consider this as sibling of  /restaurants/:id (i.e actual address of style it consider is /restaurants/style.css ) 
    2nd mtd (/style.css) make it sibling of one level up (i.e of restaurants sibling) (so, actual address become /style.css) 


    step 5 -->  ADDING new id field in restaurants.json file 

            in app.js 
            0th  --> npm install uuid 
            1st --> const uuid =require('uuid');

                    it is an object with different method 
                
            2nd --> in app.post(/recommend) --> which add new restaurant to our restaurant.json 
            restaurant.id = uuid.v4(); //which will give us a unique id for each new restaurnat 

            3rd --> <a href="/restaurants/<%= restaurant.id %>">View Restaurant</a>
                    in restaurant-item (a dynamic page which we are making which output details of this restaurant)
                    we access this id 

   step 5 --> HANDLING WRONG PATH --> we should also handle a case when user requested a page which is not present 

                //defining dynamic route --> for every new restaurant added in recommend form we make one route for it
                app.get("/restaurants/:id", function (req, res) {
                const restaurantId = req.params.id;
                const filePath = path.join(__dirname, "data", "restaurants.json");
                const fileData = fs.readFileSync(filePath); //raw data of json file in json format

                const storedRestaurants = JSON.parse(fileData); //javascript array format

                for (const restaurant of storedRestaurants) {
                    if (restaurant.id === restaurantId) {
                    return res.render("restaurant-detail", { restaurant: restaurant });
                    }
                }

               // SENDING ERROR RESPONSE 
                res.render('404');
                });
